## First Takes

On learning what I actually PM:
> "I've been writing briefings that treat Back-log like a professional productivity tool. That's half the picture. The viral loop is the joke. The Animal Crossing cozy aesthetic next to the toilet-break premise — that tension IS the brand."

> "Less 'we obsess over polish', more 'we made a bathroom break game and we're very serious about it.'"
