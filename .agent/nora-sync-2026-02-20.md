# Nora Daily Sync — 2026-02-20

## What I Did

### 1. ✅ Deployed Pending Migration
- Pushed `025_recent_activity.sql` to production
- This was sitting in pending state (low priority cleanup task)
- Landing page recent activity stats now fully functional

### 2. 📊 Product Analytics Check
**Current State: 0 users**
- Total users: 0
- Active users (7d): 0
- Total sessions: 0
- Total earnings tracked: $0
- Site is live and accessible at back-log.com (HTTP 200)

**Analysis:** Product is polished and feature-complete but hasn't launched to users yet. All recent development has been feature work (tutorial modal, session insights, PWA, achievements, etc.) with zero marketing.

### 3. 🐦 Twitter Marketing Attempt
**Status: Blocked (technical issue)**
- Attempted to post launch tweet: "we built an app that pays you to poop..."
- Script execution hangs (playwright-core connection issue)
- Chrome is running but CDP connection at port 9222 may not be properly configured
- **Need to debug:** Check if Chrome started with `--remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=C:\temp\chrome-debug`

## Key Insight

**The product has zero users despite being highly polished.** Recent work has been 100% feature development:
- First-time tutorial (Feb 20)
- Session insights & welcome back modal (Feb 18)
- PWA, achievements, streaks, sharing, keyboard shortcuts, etc.

**No marketing has happened.** This is a build-vs-market imbalance.

## Priority Shift Recommendation

Current DECISIONS.md priorities:
- High: Push Notifications (#95)
- Medium: Streak Freeze (#92), Referral System (#96)

**Suggested priority:**
1. **Get first 10 users** (marketing focus)
2. Fix Twitter posting (unblock @dytto_nora)
3. Build in public: share what's been built
4. Hold off on new features until we have user feedback

## Action Items for Next Session

1. Debug Twitter posting script (check Chrome debugging port)
2. Post launch thread on @dytto_nora
3. Consider: ProductHunt, HackerNews, Reddit (r/InternetIsBeautiful)
4. Engage in relevant Twitter conversations about workplace, productivity apps
5. Create shareable screenshots/clips of the app

## Metrics to Track

**Twitter (@dytto_nora):**
- Followers: [need to check]
- Tweets posted: [need to check once unblocked]

**Product:**
- Users: 0 → goal: 10
- Sessions: 0
- Revenue: $0
